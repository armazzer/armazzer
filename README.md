### Hi, I'm Alice ðŸ‘‹

I have a PhD in Biochemical Engineering and have worked for several years in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. Over the years I discovered my fascination with data, so decided to upskill by completing an intensive coding and data analytics course with [AiCore](https://www.theaicore.com/).
\
So, here I am! 
### Techniques
- Data Visualization
- Extract, Transform, Load (ETL)
- Statistical Modeling 
### Tools
- Python, OOP and Pandas
- Microsoft Power BI
- PostgreSQL
- Azure and AWS
- Git and GitHub - version control
- LaTeX

I'm a purpose-driven individual, eager to devote my working hours to a great cause. I'd love to be involved in building a sustainable future, progressive approaches to healthcare, or simply improving people's day to day lives.
